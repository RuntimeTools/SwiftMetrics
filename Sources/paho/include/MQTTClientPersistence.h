/**
 * @file
 * \brief This structure represents a persistent data store, used to store 
 * outbound and inbound messages, in order to achieve reliable messaging.
 *
 * The MQTT Client persists QoS1 and QoS2 messages in order to meet the
 * assurances of delivery associated with these @ref qos levels. The messages 
 * are saved in persistent storage
 * The type and context of the persistence implementation are specified when 
 * the MQTT client is created (see MQTTClient_create()). The default 
 * persistence type (::MQTTCLIENT_PERSISTENCE_DEFAULT) uses a file system-based
 * persistence mechanism. The <i>persistence_context</i> argument passed to 
 * MQTTClient_create() when using the default peristence is a string 
 * representing the location of the persistence directory. If the context 
 * argument is NULL, the working directory will be used. 
 *
 * To use memory-based persistence, an application passes 
 * ::MQTTCLIENT_PERSISTENCE_NONE as the <i>persistence_type</i> to 
 * MQTTClient_create(). This can lead to message loss in certain situations, 
 * but can be appropriate in some cases (see @ref qos).
 *
 * Client applications can provide their own persistence mechanism by passing
 * ::MQTTCLIENT_PERSISTENCE_USER as the <i>persistence_type</i>. To implement a
 * custom persistence mechanism, the application must pass an initialized
 * ::MQTTClient_persistence structure as the <i>persistence_context</i> 
 * argument to MQTTClient_create().
 *
 * If the functions defined return an ::MQTTCLIENT_PERSISTENCE_ERROR then the 
 * state of the persisted data should remain as it was prior to the function 
 * being called. For example, if Persistence_put() returns 
 * ::MQTTCLIENT_PERSISTENCE_ERROR, then it is assumed tha tthe persistent store
 * does not contain the data that was passed to the function. Similarly,  if 
 * Persistence_remove() returns ::MQTTCLIENT_PERSISTENCE_ERROR then it is 
 * assumed that the data to be removed is still held in the persistent store.
 *
 * It is up to the persistence implementation to log any error information that
 * may be required to diagnose a persistence mechanism failure.
